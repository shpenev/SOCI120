## Frequency Distribution

A table reporting the number of observations falling into each category of the variable

Example: US Population by Marital Status, mln.

|   | 1990|2000|2005|2010| 
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Total | 181.8 | 201.8 | 217.2 | 229.1|
| Never married | 40.4 | 48.2 | 53.9 | 61.5|
| Married | 112.6 | 120.1 | 127.4 | 129.5|
| Widowed | 13.8 | 13.7 | 13.8 | 14.3 |
| Divorced | 15.1 | 19.8 | 22.1 | 23.7 |

## Frequency Distribution

Why did the population of married individuals change?

- Likelihood of marriage and divorce changed
- Selection (more people survive, life expectancy longer)
- Total population increased

## Proportions

To eliminate the effect of population size, we use proportions

$$p = \frac{f}{N} $$
where

- f - frequency in the category
- N - total number of cases

In popular literature, proportions are often multiplied by 100 to get percentages.

## Percentage distribution

We can now construct a table showing the percentage of observations falling into each category

| Age | Frequency | Proportion | Percentage |
| --- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 0   | 1         | 1/25 = 0.04| 4 %        |
| 1   | 1         | 1/25 = 0.04| 4 %        |
| 2   | 3         | 3/25 = 0.12| 12 %       |
| 3   | 5         | 5/25 = 0.2 | 20 %       |
| 4   | 15        | 15/25 = 0.6| 60 %       |


## Cumulative frequency distribution

The distribution showing frequency at or below each categori of the variable

| Age | Frequency | Proportion | Cumulative frequency |
| --- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 0   | 1         | 0.04| 0.04        |
| 1   | 1         | 0.04| 0.08        |
| 2   | 3         | 0.12| 0.2       |
| 3   | 5         | 0.2 | 0.4      |
| 4   | 15        | 0.6| 1     |

You can also calculate cumulative proportions and percentages


## Frequency distributions and scales

The tables we just saw are best suited for nominal and ordinal data.

When our variable is interval-ratio, we might want to create groups (e.g. age groups 0 - 10, 11 - 20 etc.)


## Rate

Frequency distributions are meant for observations taken at a given moment. If we are interested in events that happen over time, we might calculate rates.

Rates can be defined as frequencies of events over a given period of time. 

Don't forget that "time" flies separately for each individual, so if 2 people live a year, they will together accumulate 2 years of time.

$$ Rate = \frac{f}{Exposure} $$

$$ Exposure = Population * Time $$
 When population changes (e.g. due to births, deaths, migration etc., calculate the average population)

## Graphs

Here's an example of a graph that shows 6 variables in 2 dimensions:

- Pie charts
- Bar charts
